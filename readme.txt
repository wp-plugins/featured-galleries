Do you like giving posts a Featured Image? Try out a Featured Gallery. It's like a Featured Images ... except as many images as you want.

== Description ==

= Hello Theme Developers! =

Have you ever added a Featured Image to a post and thought to yourself, 'I wish I could add more than one image this way'? Well, now you can. "Featured Galleries" mirrors the Featured Images functionality of WordPress. The only difference is that posts get an entire gallery rather than just a single image. These galleries behave almost exactly like Featured Images, and make use of  WordPress's built in Media Manager. Users can select images, define the order, and save the gallery, all through a simple drag-n-drop interface.

**Note**: This is not a plugin which will add galleries to your website. This is for theme developers. It handles the backend interface for creating featured galleries, and storing them. You will still need to build a gallery on your page templates. That said, I'm in the process of building several example galleries, and will be adding them along with tutorials given the multiple requests.

= --Instructions-- =

Just like with Featured Images themes will need to call a Featured Gallery in any template file where the Featured Gallery should appear. I've tried to make this as intuitive as possible.

Just like WordPress comes with `get_post_thumbnail_id()` built-in, you can use `get_post_gallery_ids()` to call the Featured Gallery. It needs the post's ID, and will return a PHP array with the ID's of all images in the post's Featured Gallery. Additionally you can send a second argument, "string", which will cause the function to return a comma-delimited string instead of an array.

= --Examples-- =

This example pulls the entire Featured Gallery, as an array, then loops through to display each as an `img`.

    $galleryArray = get_post_gallery_ids($post->ID); 

    <?php foreach ($galleryArray as $id) { 

        <img src="<?php echo wp_get_attachment_url( $id ); ?>">

    <?php } ?>

You can additionally request a comma-delimited string, instead of an array.

    $galleryString = get_post_gallery_ids($post->ID,"string"); 

    echo $galleryString;

Finally, you may want to just grab the first image of the gallery. You can do this by specifying the number of images to return. The default is `-1`, which returns all. Setting this to `1` instead, as shown below, will get you only one image.

    $galleryArray = get_post_gallery_ids($post->ID,1); 

    <?php foreach ($galleryArray as $id) { 

        <img src="<?php echo wp_get_attachment_url( $id ); ?>">

    <?php } ?>

= Adding Featured Galleries to a Custom Post Type =

I've included a hook to allow you to easily integrate featured galleries into a custom post type. In your theme `functions.php` file, simply add this:

    
    function add_featured_galleries_to_ctp( $post_types ) {
        return array('customposttypeslug');
    }
    add_filter('fg_post_types', 'add_featured_galleries_to_ctp' );

= Want to Help? =

I'd love some help with internationalization. I'm not sure how to do that. Also, if anyone wants to take a look at `admin.js`, which calls up the media manager, I feel like the way that I open it to the gallery-edit state could be improved. (Opens to` featured-gallery` state, plugs in pre-selected images, then changes state to `gallery-edit`, and plugs in pre-selected images. Couldn't get selection to transfer, so there's a weird flash as it propagates.)

== Installation ==

There are two ways to install this plugin.

Manual:

1. Upload the `featured-galleries` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Go to the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress, find 'Featured Galleries' in the list, and select 'Activate'.

Through the WP Repository:

1. Go to the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress, click on the 'Add New' button.
2. Search for 'Featured Galleries'. Click 'Install Now'.
3. Return to the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress, find 'Featured Galleries' in the list, and select 'Activate'.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is the point of this? =

I was tasked to update a Featured Projects page for a client website. Projects were a custom post type, and the page displaying them used a special WP_Query. Each Project had a featured image. The client wanted each to have several images that could be clicked through with arrows. I couldn't find an easy way to accomplish this, so I built it from scratch. A friend suggested I abstract it into a plugin to share.

= Will it be improved? =

Possibly. Do you have any suggestions? What I'd really like to see is the functionality adopted into the core. We have featured images, why not featured galleries?

= Can I place the metabox in both the sidebar and under the editor? =

Yes! Turns out there is CSS that lets me changes the behavor of the preview thumbnails depending on the position, so it should look good both in both positions.

= Can I add a featured gallery to my custom post type? =

Why yes you can! You don't even have to edit the plugin to do so. There are details on how to do this in the Instructions.

== Screenshots ==

1. Initial metabox, no images in the gallery.
2. Metabox with images selected and added.
